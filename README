Getting Started
===============

To get a fast introduction on how to use the ASTERICS framework, 
we advise you to take a look at the ASTERICS manual.

Chapter 2 "Using ASTERICS" gives information on 
 * how to setup ASTERICS (2.1) and
 * how to get startet with the reference demo design (2.2).

The manual and a snapshot of the ASTERICS framework are available at:

  http://ees.hs-augsburg.de/asterics



Licensing and Additonal Modules
===============================

This document and the mentioned download link refer to the free and publicly
available part of ASTERICS. This part is generally licensed under the LPGL
(see LICENSE for details).

However, there are more ASTERICS modules available, which are presently not
published under an open source license, but that can be made available
individually on a per-project basis. These include modules for:

* the Generalized Hough Transform and other variants of the Hough Transform
  [1, 2]

* low latency lense distortion removal and stereo rectification (NITRA) [4, 5]

* efficient, on-the-fly point feature extraction (SURF algorithm) [3]

Please contact the Efficient Embedded Systems (EES) group at the University of
Applied Sciences Augsburg (see "authors" section on top of the file) for
further information on using these modules and collaborating with the EES group.

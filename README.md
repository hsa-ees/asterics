# ASTERICS - An Open Toolbox for Sophisticated FPGA-Based Image Processing

Image processing on embedded platforms is a challenging task, especially when implementing extensive computer vision applications. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) offer a suitable technology to accelerate image processing by customized hardware.

*ASTERICS* ("Augsburg Sophisticated Toolbox for Embedded Real-time Image Crunching Systems") is a modular framwork to perform various real-time image processing tasks. It offers modules and interfaces to perform various image processing including support for complex operations such as natural feature detection based on the *SURF* algorithm or variants of the *Generalized Hough Transform*.

This repository contains the core and free components of the *ASTERICS* framework. A list of publications and further information on the project can be found on the home page of the [Efficient Embedded Systems](http://ees.hs-augsburg.de) group at the University of Applied Sciences Augsburg.

\section{Overview on the \asterics Software Stack}

\secauthor{Alexander Zöllner, Philip Manke, Gundolf Kiefer}

\asterics offers a sophisticated software stack, which allows to conveniently interface any kind of \asterics-based hardware image processing chain. 
The software stack is divided into layers, which gradually abstract from the actual hardware. 
Figure~\ref{fig:software-stack} shows the layers of the \asterics software stack, ranging from implementation specifics at the bottom, up to user application software at the top. 
\textit{Layer 0} comprises vendor and platform specific libraries of the utilized FPGA and CPU, which are included depending on the chosen settings in the \asterics configuration. 
The \asterics configuration contains supported features available to \asterics, such as the type of operating system.
 
The \asterics \textit{Support Library} (\textit{ASL}), located in \textit{Layer 1}, adopts the settings of the \asterics configuration, includes required vendor and platform libraries. 
The \textit{ASL} performs actual accesses to the underlying hardware and thus is the only part of the \asterics software stack with external dependencies. 
Unified interfaces are offered to the higher layers, which are unaffected by the settings of the \asterics configuration. 
Merely their underlying implementation in the \textit{ASL} are altered. 

\textit{Layer 2} contains the \asterics module drivers, which offer methods for accessing the corresponding hardware module and obtaining its status information by using the interfaces provided by the \textit{ASL}. 
The module drivers also define descriptive aliases for address calculation and proper bit masking. 

The \texttt{asterics.h} library in \textit{Layer 3} is the resulting library for the application software and includes the \asterics module drivers as well as  the \textit{ASL}.
It also contains specific information about the hardware image processing chain implemented on the FPGA, such as absolute addresses of the hardware modules.

The application software in \textit{Layer 4} is able to access the interfaces of each layer directly by including \texttt{asterics.h}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 4.2. ASTERICS Support Library %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\section{The \asterics Support Library (ASL)}

\secauthor{Alexander Zöllner, Gundolf Kiefer}


The \textit{\asterics Support Library} is the main interface between hardware and application software within the \asterics framework.
It contains all vendor and platform dependencies for performing the actual hardware accesses.
Towards software, the \textit{ASL} offers static register-based interfaces to the \asterics hardware modules of the hardware image processing chain and a number of utilities, such as for synchronization or memory allocation.
The \textit{ASL} uses the appropriate implementation for the corresponding functionality, depending on the environment parameter settings within \texttt{as\_config.h}.
Therefore, the \textit{ASL} has to be included across the \asterics software stack, whenever a piece of software indents to access the hardware or utilizing mechanics which are platform dependent.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 4.3. ASTERICS Support Package %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\section{Contents of an \asterics Support Package (ASP)}

\secauthor{Alexander Zöllner, Philip Manke, Gundolf Kiefer}

Table~\ref{table:asp-contents} shows the contents of an \textit{\asterics Support Package}, used for describing a specific hardware image processing chain and choosing the target environment of the \textit{ASP}.
If a given hardware image processing chain is to be utilized for several environments, a corresponding \textit{ASP} has to be provided for each one.
Although most contents of the \asterics software stack can be copied for multiple \textit{ASPs} and processing chains, some parts have to be replaced, since they depend on the actual hardware implementation and the environment.
The files \texttt{asterics.h} and \texttt{as\_config.mk} are the only ones which are affected.
The former has to be updated each time the underlying hardware image processing chain is altered in regards of its modules.
This mainly includes adding or removing hardware modules, changing their pre-synthesis parameters or their absolute start address.
Therefore, it is recommended to update the \textit{asterics.h} header file each time one of the parameters of the hardware image processing chain is touched.
On the other hand, the \texttt{as\_config.mk} file reflects the settings of the environment, on which the \textit{ASP} and hardware image processing chain is deployed.
Prominent parameters are the whether an operating system is utilized or the SoC vendor, who usually provides low level software drivers for interfacing the hardware.
Thus, it only needs to be replaced when the target environment changes (which usually occurs less frequent than changing the hardware implementation during development).
The remaining files of the \textit{ASP} are left untouched across multiple hardware image processing chains and environments.

\section{2D Pipeline Generator} \label{ch:06-04-tools-pipegen}

\secauthor{Alexander ZÃ¶llner}

\subsection{Brief Description}
The \textit{2D Pipeline Generator} is a script-based tool for building a 2D pipeline in a semi-automatic way.
Required filter masks for the 2D window modules are extracted from images using the program Gimp.
The resulting 2D pipeline consists of storage elements for each data type and a number of \textit{2D Window Interfaces}.

Note: A similar functionality has been implemented into the Python script based generator Automatics, which will eventually supersede this generator tool.

\subsubsection{Hardware Components}

Table~\ref{06-04-pipeline-generator-components} lists the required hardware components for the 2D Pipeline Generator in order to build the pipeline.

\subsubsection{Generator Input}
In order to build the 2D pipeline, the 2D Pipeline Generator has to determine the required interfaces.
Therefore, an image for each filter mask has to be provided using the image program Gimp (of version 2.8).
In the first step, a new image has to be created. 
The height of the image has to match the one of the filter mask and the width the resolution of the image in x direction.
For the filter mask, a new layer has to be created, matching the size of the image.
The layer should be named appropriately, since the generator uses the same name for the corresponding interface of the filter mask.
Further, the background layer has to be deleted.
The in- and output positions of the 2D window module are chosen by coloring the associated pixel, as shown in table~\ref{06-04-pipeline-generator-filter-masks}.
Reference pixels are solely for visual user assistance, e.g. marking the center pixel of a Gaussian filter mask.
In a final step, the generated image has to be exported in a png format.

\begin{longtable}[ht]{|c|c|c|c|}

  & In & Ref. & Out \\
  \hline
  In & \cellcolor{red!75}0xff0000 & \cellcolor{yellow!75}0xffff00 & \cellcolor{magenta!75}0xff00ff \\
  \hline
  Ref. & \cellcolor{yellow!75}0xffff00 & \cellcolor{green!75}0x00ff00 & \cellcolor{cyan!25}0x00ffff \\
  \hline
  Out & \cellcolor{magenta!75}0xff00ff & \cellcolor{cyan!25}0x00ffff & \cellcolor{blue!75}0x0000ff \\
  \hline

\end{longtable}

The in- and output ports of the filter masks have to be associated with their corresponding data type to infer the required amount of storage elements and connecting them correctly.
For this reason, an input file, namely \textit{data.txt} has to be provided, which contains labels for all data types with their associated bit width.
An entry has the format \texttt{<label>:<bit-width>}, where the \textit{label} must only contain letters (a-z, A-Z) and the \textit{bit-width} only digits (0-9).

Data types are associated with the filter masks by assigning the labels to the ports of a given filter port.
This is done in the \textit{connections.txt}, which is an output of the 2D Pipeline Generator.

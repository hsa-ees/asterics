\subsection{as\_collect}

\secauthor{Julian Sarcher, Alexander ZÃ¶llner}

\subsubsection{Brief Description}

The collect module collects smaller data words (e.g. 8 bit wide) until a certain bit width is reached. As the desired bit width is reached, the collect module forwards the larger data word. An example usage for this module is collecting 8-bit gray scale pixels for 32 or 64 bit memory bus accesses.

\subsection{as\_stream\_adapter}

\secauthor{Philip Manke}

\subsubsection{Brief Description}

The module \texttt{as\_stream\_adapter} is capable of adjusting the bit width of an \texttt{as\_stream}'s data signal without modifying the data contents.
Almost arbitrary combinations of bit width conversions are possible.
The module can both collect data to implement a narrow to wide conversion and disperse data to implement a wide to narrow conversion.
Furthermore, the bit widths converted between do not have to be multiples of each other.

Valid conversions are, for example:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-0.2em}
\item 8 to 32 bits
\item 32 to 8 bits
\item 32 to 24 bits
\item 8 to 1 bit
\item 17 to 32 bits
\end{itemize}
 
\textit{Note:}
The module's FPGA resource requirements scale by the least common multiple between the configured input and output bit widths.

\subsubsection{Behavior}

This module can operate in three different modes defined by the values of \texttt{DIN\_WIDTH} and \texttt{DOUT\_WIDTH}:

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{-0.2em}
\item \textbf{Collection mode} (\texttt{DIN\_WIDTH > DOUT\_WIDTH}): The bit width of the data signal is increased.
\item \textbf{Dispersion mode} (\texttt{DIN\_WIDTH < DOUT\_WIDTH}): The bit width of the data signal is decreased.
\item \textbf{Pass-through mode} (\texttt{DIN\_WIDTH = DOUT\_WIDTH}): The bit width of the data signal is not modified.
\end{itemize}

In general, this module delays the data signal by at one clock cycle.
The data signal will be delayed more when \texttt{as\_stream\_adapter} is operating in collect mode.
When enough data has been accumulated in the internal buffer to allow for a data word to be output, this will happen one clock cycle after the last data word was received.
Any synchronization signals (\texttt{vsync, hsync,} etc.) received while data is collected will be output with the next data word.


In disperse mode, the module will emit a stall signal when the internal buffer is full.
A clock cycle before the final data word is send by the module, it will stop emitting the stall signal.
This gives the preceding modules a relatively short notice to start sending more data.
This may result in an underutilization of the following modules, as any delay longer than one clock cycle will result in a delay at the module's output.
Any synchronization signals (\texttt{vsync, hsync,} etc.) received with an incoming data word are output once with the first data word that contains part of the received data word.


Pass-through mode can make sense when used in conjunction with the strobe counter feature built-in to the module.
Otherwise this mode does not provide any functionality, except for a one clock cycle delay.

\infobox{The module \texttt{as\_global\_processing} is currently not supported by the system generator Automatics and will likely be replaced by \texttt{as\_base\_registers} in the future.}

\subsubsection{Brief Description}
The \texttt{as\_global\_processing} is the software driver for the \texttt{asterics\_state/control} register for requesting the state of the \asterics-chain as well as for performing a reset on it.
Access functions are provided by this software driver for accessing the aforementioned register correctly without having to remember the actual bit fields of the hardware mapping.
It is expected that the status and control fields of the hardware modules within the \asterics-chain are mapped correctly to the fields of the \texttt{asterics\_state/control} register.


\subsubsection{Register Interface}
The register space is part of the \textit{Common Control and Status Registers} described in Chapter~\ref{ch:05-01-interfaces-general-common}.

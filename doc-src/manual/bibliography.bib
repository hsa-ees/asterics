	abstract = {The paper presents an efficient and flexible framework for extensive image processing tasks. While most available frameworks concentrate on pixel-based modules and interfaces for image preprocessing tasks, our proposal also covers the seamless integration of higher-level algorithms. Window-oriented filter operations, such as noise filters, edge filters or natural feature detectors, are performed within an efficient 2D window pipeline. This structure is generated and optimized automatically based on a user-defined filter configuration. For complex, higher-level algorithms, an optimized array of independent, software-based processing units is generated. As an example application, we chose object recognition based on the well-known {SURF} algorithm (“Speeded Up Robust Features”), which performs natural feature detection and description. All involved image processing steps were successfully mapped to our architecture. Thus, exploiting the {FPGAs} full potential regarding parallelism, we synthesized one of the most efficient {SURF} detectors and a complete object recognition system in a single mid-size {FPGA}.},

	title = {A Configurable Architecture for the Generalized Hough Transform Applied to the Analysis of Huge Aerial Images and to Traffic Sign Detection},
	doi = {10.1109/ReConFig.2016.7857143},
	abstract = {Object recognition in huge image data sets or in live camera images at interactive frame rates is a very demanding task, especially within embedded systems. The recognition task includes the localization of a reference object and its rotation and scaling in a search image. The Generalized Hough Transform ({GHT}) is known as a powerful and robust technique to support this task by transforming the search image into a 4D parameter space. However, the {GHT} itself is very complex and demanding towards computational power and memory consumption. This paper presents a novel hardware architecture to perform a complete 4D {GHT} at interactive frame rates in an {FPGA}. The architecture is configurable in order to allow a trade-off between performance, accuracy and hardware usage. The proposed architecture has been implemented in a low-cost Zynq-7000 {FPGA} and successfully evaluated in two practical applications, namely groyne detection in aerial images and traffic sign detection.},

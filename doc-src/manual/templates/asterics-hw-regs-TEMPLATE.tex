%% Description: Template file for describing hardware registers for data exchange 
%%              between hw and sw. Two tables are provided for a given register.
%%              The first one is used for stating general information and the 
%%              second one for describing the individual bit fields and their 
%%              meaning. A bit field is a logically grouped number of bits.

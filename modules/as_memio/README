This directory contains files for the ASTERICS Streaming-Interface as_memio.

The as_memio only consists of software files which provide functions for 
enhancing the functionality of the hardware modules as_memreader and 
as_memwriter. For this reason, there is no subdirectory hardware since 
as_memio is based on the previously mentioned already existing hardware 
modules.

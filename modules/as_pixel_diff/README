Description:    
This module takes two as_stream interfaces as inputs and outputs one as_stream interface.
The outgoing as_stream pixels are the difference between the two input streams.
This module does not handle any synchronization tasks and only operates when the "strobe" signals of both input streams are '1' simultaneously.

Description:    
The as_sim_image_reader module reads data from a csv-file 
and converts the data to a pixel stream.
The as_sim_image_writer module receives a data stream and 
writes it into a csv-file.

Caution:
When using the as_sim_image_writer module for ghdl 
simulation, all files have to be analyzed with the --std=08 
option for the IEEE.STD_LOGIC_TEXTIO.ALL!

e.g.
ghdl -a --std=08 my_file.vhd
ghdl -e --std=08 my_testbench

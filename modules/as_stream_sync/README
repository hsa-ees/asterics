Description:    
ASTERICS module that takes in two as_stream interfaces and outputs both synchronously.
Timing signals like HSYNC and VSYNC are not taken into account.
Synchronization is solely done using the strobe signal.
This module is meant to snychronize two as_streams that may start sending data 
!of the same length! at different times and implements a FIFO buffer of
configurable size.

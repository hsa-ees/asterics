This directory contains the source files for the ASTERICS device driver.

Contents:
=========

- Makefile
- README
- as_config.h
- as_driver.[hc]
- as_linux_kernel_if.h


as_driver.[hc]
--------------
These files contain the driver itself which contains the functionality for 
interfacing an ASTERICS-chain from Linux user space.


as_config.h
-----------
Shows an exemplary configuration for compiling the ASTERICS device driver
"AS_OS_LINUX_KERNEL" has to be set to "1", whereas all other "*_OS_" and "_BSP_"
settings have to be "0".

The remaining parameters are currently not taken into account.


as_linux_kernel_if.h
--------------------
This file provides structures and defines mainly for using the various "ioctl"
methods of the driver.




Linux Kernel Headers
====================

Since the ASTERICS driver is currently only used with Xilinx SoCs, the 
installation of the required kernel headers are explained for this vendor. 
(Other vendors may deploy a similar scheme)
The below listed steps have to be carried out when installing the Linux kernel 
headers on the host or embedded platform.


Clone git repo:
...............

$ git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx.git

Note for embedded platform:
You can put the kernel headers in any directory, but they are usually located in 
/lib/modules/<kernel-release>

To get the string for your kernel on the embedded platform you can type:

$ uname -r

By re-naming the obtained directory "linux-xlnx" into the string obtained by 
the above command and placing it in "/lib/modules" you can use the commonly 
used command "KDIR	:= /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)" in your Makefile.

You CANNOT use "uname -r" on your host system, since the kernel version most 
likely differs from the one of your embedded platform!


Checkout the tag associated with the used Vivado version:
.........................................................

At the time this README has been created, Vivado 2017.2 has been prominently used

$ cd linux-xlnx
$ git checkout xilinx-v2017.2


Perform bugfix for xilinx-v2017.2 tag (probably fixed in later versions):
.........................................................................

In file common.c in arch/arm/mach-zynq/:

static void __init zynq_memory_init(void)
{
	if(!__pa(PAGE_OFFSET))
-       memblock_reserve(__pa(PAGE_OFFSET), __pa(swapper_pg_dir));
+       memblock_reserve(__pa(PAGE_OFFSET), 0x80000);
}

$ git add arch/arm/mach-zynq/common.c
$ git commit -s -a -m "getting rid of -dirty"


Source Xilinx environment:
..........................

Only to be performed on host platform!

For example:
$ source /opt/Xilinx/xilinx-vivado-2017_2-settings.sh


Build kernel modules:
.....................

$ make modules


Solve dependencies 
..................

(gets rid of compiler warnings when building kernel modules)

$ depmod

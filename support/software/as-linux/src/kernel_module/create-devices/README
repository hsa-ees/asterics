create-devices.c
===============================================================================
This file contains the functionality for building creating the actual devices 
for the ASTERICS device driver using the "ioctl" method of the drivers "as_control"
device.
The "as_control" device is the only one which is not created by "create-devices.c".


load_devices.sh
===============================================================================
Calls the executable of "create-devices" and creates corresponding nodes on the 
file system.
The number of devices and their type are part of "as_hardware.[hc]".


load_driver.sh
===============================================================================
Loads the kernel module of the ASTERICS device driver to the kernel.


unload_devices.sh
===============================================================================
This script uses "create-devices" for deleting all devices of the ASTERICS 
device driver except the "as_control" device.
Additionally, all nodes on the file system are deleted (including the one for 
the "as_control" device).


unload_driver.sh
===============================================================================
Removes the kernel module of the ASTERICS device driver from the kernel.

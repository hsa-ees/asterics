System Name: as_refdesign_zynq


Development environment: Xilinx Vivado 2017.2


Target Boards: 
  * Digilent ZYBO board (Zynq Z-7010, XC7Z010)

  Note: Vivado Board Files must be installed!
   Ensure you have installed the Vivado Board Files for your target
   board. These files can be obtained from Digilent or Avnet (they call 
   it "Board Definitions") and are placed in the Vivado installation
   directory at '%Vivado-Dir/data/boards/board_files/'.


Additional hardware required:
  * OmniVision OV7670 image sensor, connected to Pmods JB and JC (Zybo)
     -> use a "OV7670-Pmod Adapter v0.3" board for connection 
        (see 'doc/' for information on the adapter board)
  * a monitor, connected to the HDMI port (Zybo)


Info on Vivado IP cores:
  * ASTERICS: image data capture, processing and writing data to memory
  * VEARS: for visualization (part of the ASTERICS framework)


Software / demo system usage:
  The demo software is located at 'software/'. See the ASTERICS 
  reference software (should be part of the ASTERICS refernce design, 
  located at 'asterics/') for further details.


**************
* Quickstart *
**************
  0) For proper operation of Vivado (needed to generate an ASTERICS IP 
     core for Vivado and to build the system) make sure you source your 
     Vivado environment:
     > source <VIVADO-DIR>/settings64.sh
     
     Make sure you source the ASTERICS environment prior to any action 
     in the project folder:
     > source <ASTERICS-DIR>/settings.sh

  1) Change to your project folder and build the ASTERICS IP core for 
     use with Vivado (which will be integrated in the system):
     > make asterics_vivado_cores

  2) Build the whole system (hardware platform and demo software).
     This step will take some minutes:
     > make build_system

  3) Connect your Zybo with a monitor (HDMI port) and connect to your 
     computer. Also power on the board.
     Then upload the hardware and software to the board:
     > make run
     For usage instructions of the demo software please refer to the 
     README of the recent ASTERICS design.



****************
* Make Targets *
****************

  Following make targets help to use ASTERICS, either to use it to
  generate a vendor independent core or to build a complete system
  which is put to operation on the target board.

  * asterics_core :         Generate a general ASTERICS core
                            using "as_automatics", without the need for
                            vendor tools (e.g. Vivado) or a board.
                            Useful for vendor-indepenent evaluation of
                            the ASTERICS framework / generator,
                            but not needed for the system generation
                            and board operation (for this, we use the
                            target 'asterics_vivado_cores' instead).

  * asterics_vivado_cores : Generate the ASTERICS IP core for
                            Xilinx Vivado using "as_automatics"
                            and populate the software reference
                            implementation.

  * build_system:           Generate and build the whole demo system
                            (hardware + software) from sources.
                      NOTE: run target 'asterics_vivado_cores' before!

  * run:                    Run the demo on the target board.
                      NOTE: run target 'build_system' before!

  * all / build_and_run :   The lazy target: performs all needed steps
                            automatically, no more interaction needed.
                            This one uses following targets:
                              1) asterics_vivado_cores
                              2) build_system
                              3) run
                            Just make sure to connect the board, as it
                            will be programmed right after hardware and
                            software are built.

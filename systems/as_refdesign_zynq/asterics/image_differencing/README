ASTERICS Design: "image_differencing"


ASTERICS Modules:
  * as_sensor_ov7670
  * as_stream_splitter
  * as_memreader
  * as_stream_sync
  * as_pixel_diff
  * as_collect
  * as_memwriter


Description of the ASTERICS chain:
  This ASTERICS reference design implements a set of ASTERICS modules to
  perform image differencing on subsequent camera images.
  Images are acquired by an OmniVision OV7670 image sensor. 
  This imaga data stream is split to two streams: 
  1) the original image is stored unmodified to main memory. 
  2) the stream data and data from the previous image, fetched from main 
     memory, are synchronized prior to calculating pixel differences. 
     The resulting difference image is also stored to main memory.
  The VEARS ipcore is used to display the images on a monitor.


Demo operation:
  The demo design is running in a loop, controlled by a dip-switch:
    SW0: visualization select between 
          - the original image (off) or 
          - the difference image (on)
